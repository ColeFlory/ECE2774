Code Outline for Milestone 1

Classes:
- Transformer
- TransformerData
- TransmissionLine
- TransmissionLineData
- Bus
- Generator
- Network
- Solution
  
Transformer: 
- takes TransfromerData object as input
- contains bus connections
- contains impedance value
- contains primary/secondary voltages?
  
 TransformerData: Preform necessary calculations for transformer class
 - 
  
  
TransmissionLineData: Preforms calculations for Transmission Line class, to be passed in as an object
- Should take in the radius, number of conductors, coordinates of conductors, other data about the line to calculate impedance/length. 
- 

TransmissionLine: 
- Takes TransmissionLineData object as input
- Bus connection 1
  should this check a list and then create a new bus if necessary
- Bus connection 2
  should this check a list and then create a new bus if necessary
- Length of line
  will be used to multiply with the values brought in from the TransmissionLineData object
- Impedance
  
Bus:
- Functions similar to Bus class from Simple Circuit code
  
Network:
- Dictionaries of each component
- Add functionality for each component
  creates new object of target class
  should append the related dictionary with the new item
  
 Solution:
 - takes Network object as input, similar to simple circuit code
 - solves for voltages on bus
 - power drawn from generators
